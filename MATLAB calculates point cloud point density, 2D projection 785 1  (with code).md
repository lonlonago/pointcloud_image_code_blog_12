#  I. Introduction 

>  The overall idea of calculating point density is as follows: first project the point cloud, then divide the projection points into grids, count the number of grids containing the projection points, and finally divide the number of points with the statistical area to calculate the out-point density value. 

#  Implementation code 

>  PointDenstity.m 

 ```python

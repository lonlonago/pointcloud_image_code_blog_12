#  I. Introduction 

>  For the specific principle of European-style clustering, please refer to the previous article: MATLAB European-style clustering. Here, use MATLAB built-in functions to achieve the clustering effect. It is worth noting that MATLAB's built-in European-style clustering is not the original European-style clustering algorithm. It is improved on the basis of the original algorithm. Its principle is similar to the code in this blog: MATLAB Fast European Clustering (FEC)

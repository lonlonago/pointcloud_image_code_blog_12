#  I. Introduction 

>  There are many sorting algorithms for single-profile data points, the simplest of which is the search algorithm based on the nearest point. The idea of the closest point search algorithm is to select a point as the starting point, search for the point closest to the starting point in the remaining points, and record it as the new starting point. Until all the remaining points are searched, the sorting of single-profile data points is completed.
